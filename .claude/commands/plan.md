You are going to make a plan for the implementation of: 

$ARGUMENTS

remember to use these files as guidance for your work: 
    - @CLAUDE.md 
    - @ai/context.md 
    - @ai/spec.md 
    - @ai/progress.md 
    - @ai/rules.md 

you will not include any estimates on timing

you will specify that for a line item in the plan, an existing unit test should be updated or a new unit test added, to cover the new functionality. after modifying a source file and test, we run a full build and the full test suite every time, to ensure no off-target impacts.
